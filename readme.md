Hemlock - Minimalistic addon to automate poison buying and creation
---------------------------------------
The entire idea is to make the entire poison-buying process as simple, fast, and brainless as possible. It doesn't make you bother with ranks or anything - it assumes you want to refill your highest-rank poison to a threshold you set.

Click once to buy the exact amount of components you need, click a second time to automatically craft your poisons.

Hemlock also keep track of your inventory so it won't buy more reagents than needed!

Numbers appears in red is when Hemlock have to buy poisons to reach the threshold, numbers are in green are when you already have enought poisons.

- Display a warning message if you don't have enough space in your inventory to buy the reagents.
